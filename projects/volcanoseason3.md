# Volcano Season 3
***This is where I will write the story of Volcano Season 3***

**NOTE: This is a rough draft and needs to be completed!**

## The Origins
Volcano Season first started as a pseudo-app for an Android phone. 

### Where The Idea Came From
Constantly checking the weather forcasts of multiple volcanoes for months on end every spring.

### The Light Bulb Ignites
After completing the introductory class to web development at OSU-Cascades,
I realized that I could make a simle HTML file that linked to all of the forecasts of the
valcanoes I was frequently checking. I then realized that I could not only save and render 
this HTML file in a Google Doc, but that I could save the file directly to the homescreen
of my Android phone. I then took this momentum and made an equipment checklist using both 
HTML and CSS. Again, I saved the Google Doc to my home screen.

The real "AH-HA!" moment came when I realized that I could group these two Google Docs
together on the homescreen. I then had quick and easy access to both the list of
forecast links and the equipment checklist! I used this pseduo-app for a little over
a year before I had the opportunity to take the next step.

### Teaching Myself Kotlin
In July of 2022 I contracted Covid-19 and wasn't able to do much other than lay on my couch for 4 days.
However, I used this opportunity to read a bunch of articles and watch a bunch of YouTube tutorials
to teach myself Kotlin and Android studio and turn the psedo-app into a real Android app. 
It was a very primitive app, and the equipment checklist was just the same HTML/CSS file albeit this time
saved in the app itself rather than Google Docs, but I thought it wasn't bad considering it was made in 4 days
with Covid-19 in a language and framework that I had never used before. I was proud of it,
but I knew I wanted to improve on it when I had more time.

### The Big Leagues
In June of 2024 I crashed my bike and spent 4 weeks on my couch in a neck brace and a
back brace (sensing a theme here?). I used this opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills
I gained about Android development from the preceding winter quarter at OSU and recreated the
primitive 2nd version into a professional-looking, portfolio-worthy app.
Volcano Season 3 is simple but highly customizable. It utilizes material cards and recycler view (check spelling)
to hold a list of links to forecasts. ...
