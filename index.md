## Personal Projects
Projects that are unrelated to but utilize the knowledge and experience gained from a CS degreen at OSU-Cascades.

### Raspberry Pi Patio Lights
A project that uses a Raspberry Pi as a smart hub for "dumb" lights that can be controlled with a radio frequency remote.
The RPi hosts an MQTT broker and a Node-RED server to receive external commands via Discord or an MQTT client.
Based on the commands, the RPi transmits an RF signal to the lights.
The Node-RED server also maintains a schedule for the lights.

### QR Coder
A simple command-line tool that takes text input and generates a QR code in any desired combination of:
- Printed to the console
- Saved as an SVG
- Saved as a PNG

The tool is based off of a portion of the OTP project in the [Intro to Security](#intro-to-security) project below.
It alows for quick and easy generation of QR codes without the need to sign up for online services.

### Bowling Scoreboard
A bowling scoreboard built in Google Sheets to help keep track of the winners and losers during competitive events on family vacations involving
a [table bowling](https://us.amazon.com/bowling-table/s?k=bowling+table) set. The sheet includes a macro to clear out the scoreboard to be ready
for the next round as quickly as possible!

Access the Google Sheets file [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T2dHcvSfGK9w3xW4Mf51phTdxzOd0TZNsUDxLNJYssI/edit?usp=sharing).
It is set as "View Only", but anyone can make a copy of it and make it their own to start editing or simply entering scores. 


## Oregon State University Projects
Projects created for specific classes at various campuses of Oregon State University from Fall 2020 to Spring 2024.

### Capstone 2024 - Integrated Test Stand
An academic year-long project involving a team of three Computer Science students.
The team partnered with a local business to develop on consolidated data recording program that incorporates
various devices on a hydrogen generator.

Read more about the project [here](https://sweisss.github.io/osu-cascades/capstone-24/IntegratedTestStand.html)

### RxWatch
An Android app created as a final project by a team of four Computer Science students for CS 492 - Mobile Development at Oregon State University, Winter 2024.
The app allows users to enter a drug name and search for other drugs that may have adverse interactions with that drug.
It uses two different endpoints of the [openFDA](https://open.fda.gov/) API to search drug labels and return statics of reported adverse events.

### Chemistry Calculations
An Excel workbook created during CH 202 - Chemistry for Engineering Majors at Oregon State University - Cascades, Fall 2020.
Seth used the massive amount of chemistry homework as an opportunity to teach himself the wonders of Excel. Each sheet corresponds with a
particular week of the course. The workbook utilizes the name manager to reference constants and values throughout the workbook from the tables
located on the first sheet.

## Element 1 Projects
Thesse projects were all made for Element 1 (e1), a company in Bend, OR that makes hydrogen generators.
Because e1 has not yet given permission to release the source code of these projects, they are only described here. 

### Remote Access Alarm Server
Worked on as an intern during Summer 2022 and 2023.
The server is written in python and uses MQTT protocol to accept incoming messages
from registered hydrogen generators. The messages can either be CAN based or in JSON from a Siemens IoT device.
Once the server receives a message, it decodes it and logs it in a csv. It also searches the message for fault codes.
If a fault code is found, it utilizes the system ID (also in the message) to forward the fault via SMTP to the engineers
associated with that system in an SQLite database. 

### TigerTamer
A desktop GUI data processing program for the [TigerOptics Prismatic 3](https://www.process-insights.com/crds-gas-analyzers-2/prismatic-3/).
TigerTamer combines the csv data files from all four of the gas channels from the "Tiger" and more importantly,
it cuts out all data outside a set date/time range selected by the user. It then graphs these data in an Excel workbook to form a report. 

As the TigerTamer project evolved, it incorporated a server and an SQLite database that is connected to the Tiger which queries the tiger every night
to update the database. The server uses a simple API that the TigerTamer client accesses via the GUI application so that the user can
retrieve the Tiger data from accross the building while connected to the local Wi-Fi network. 

### Render FAT
A Desktop GUI program to process Factory Acceptance Test data for hydrogen generators. 
The program takes csv data from the internal contorl device (e.g. PLC) and optionally from an external measuring device
(e.g. PLC recording data from a [Coriolis flow meter](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/measurement-instrumentation/flow-measurement/coriolis-flow-meters)).
The program lines up the data files based on flow movement and control states and then calculates efficiency data. 
After all data has been processed, it then writes and graphs the data in an Excel workbook (multiple Excel workbooks if it
detects multiple runs). 

### MM Calculator
A program to calculate the ideal metal mebrane area of the hydrogen purification module in the hydrogen generators.
The program uses python tkinter to present the user with a GUI where various inputs can be added, including:
- Feed mole fraction of hydrogen
- Membrane area inlet feed pressure
- Permeate pressure
- Feed flow rate
- Percent hydrogen recovery

The program then calculates the ideal membrane area along with other output data points.
It also uses Matplotlib to graph the area and the percent of hydrogen recovery.

### MoleMapper
A program to find equilibrium composition by direct minimization of Gibbs free energy,
primarily intended to calculate the elements of the water-gas shift reaction involving methanol.
This program is a python based GUI that is inspired by the
[Chemcial Equilibrium Calculator](https://navier.engr.colostate.edu/code/code-4/index.html) of Colorado Sate University: 
Chemical and Biological Engineering department. MoleMapper simplifies the CSU program by limiting the required input
entries to those necessary for the QA/QC department at Element 1. It also expands on the CSU program by allowing the
user to select a range of temperatures in which to repeatedly perform the calculations, rather than calculting for a
single temperature. The results are recorded in a CSV file. 

### Mini Reactor Reporter
A program to clean, organize, and combine a number of CSV data sheets from a miniature hydrogen reactor of the QA/QC department.
Much like TigerTamer and Render FAT, This program is a python GUI that takes in CSV data. However, rather than writing
and graphing the results in an Excel workbook, it simply creates a new CSV file with the cleaned and organized data. 

### S-Series Dockerized HMI
A new HMI for the [S-Series](https://www.e1na.com/s-series-hydrogen-generator) hydrogen generators utilizing
Docker containerization and PowerShell scripts for installation and startup.
The HMI uses a Docker compose to spin up several containers:
- [Fuxa](https://github.com/frangoteam/FUXA) for the graphical front-end of the HMI
- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) to process both system data and GUI display and commands
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) to store datapoints gathered from the system and allow the user to view triends
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to provide a better interface for interacting with the InfluxDB data
- [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) to provide an MQTT broker to assist in data transfer between services

The compose also employs several networks to facilitate the sharing of data between services. 

The project utilizes PowerShell to automatically start the compose file on login.
In addition, the project also uses a PowerShell script to automate the installation process.


## Videos
### Python Dictionaries
A video explaining some cool and interesting things that you can do with a python dictionary.
The video was originally made for a leadership project at OSU-Cascades in Spring 2024, but was really intended for a greater audience.
It coveres a brief introduction to dictionaries, how to use a dictionary as a priority queue, and how to store and call functions from within a dictionary.

### Informational Speach
A short video made for COM 111 - Public Speaking at Central Oregon Community College, Fall 2020.
It coveres some basic safety meaures to take when backcountry skiing. However, the point of the video was to learn and practice
public speaking and communication skills, not to act as an authority on safe backcountry travel or recreation.
